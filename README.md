Magento extension - Rich Snippets
=================================
This is a fork of https://github.com/mborkowski/magentoext-richsnippets

I added following functionality to the original extension:

* Organization social links, shop logo and contact information
* Sitelinks search box
* Rich snippets in category listings
* Additional product data
* Trusted Shops rating in products
* modman config file

Installation
------------

If you are using [modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman) installation is simple:

    modman clone https://github.com/jknipper/magentoext-richsnippets.git
    
Otherwise clone the repository and copy the contents of src to your project folder.
